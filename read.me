Hans PE1CKK made for me and Ruud PE1BTV a 150 mm dish with f/D 0.4 for 47 GHz. 3D printed and covered with feed subreflector. 
Surface is ALU conducting tape, accuracy is 0.1 mm. The tape is about 0.04mm.
Rule of thumb is that the accuracy of the dish should be within 10% of the wavelenght. 
For 47GHz the wavelenght is 6mm, so 0,1 mm is very good.
