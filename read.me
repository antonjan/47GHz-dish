Hans PE1CKK made for me and Ruud PE1BTV a 150 mm dish with f/D 0.4 for 47 GHz. 
3D printed with an accuracy of 0.1 mm, and covered with ALU conducting tape of ca. 0.04mm. 
Also the subreflector to be mounted on 6mm circular waveguide is included. 
Rule of thumb is that the accuracy of the dish should be within 10% of the wavelength. 
For 47GHz the wavelength is 6mm, so 0,1 mm is very good.
